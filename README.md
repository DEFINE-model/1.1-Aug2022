# DEFINE_1.1_AUG2022
This repository contains the R code for the main simulation results in: Dafermos, Y., Nikolaidi, M. (2022). ‘Assessing climate policies: an ecological stock-flow consistent perspective’, European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention, forthcoming.  

To run this code: (1) install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/); (2) click on the ‘Code’ button and download and extract the ZIP folder; (3) open the R file and run the code by clicking on the ‘Source’ button.

The code generates the Figures 1, 2 and 3 in the paper. Note that you will need to install the R package ‘Cairo’ before running the code. To do so use the command: install.packages("Cairo").

For more information about the DEFINE model, see [here](https://define-model.org/). For any questions or comments, please write to: yannis.dafermos@soas.ac.uk or m.nikolaidi@greenwich.ac.uk.
